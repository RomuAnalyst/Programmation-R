    "text": "I spent a decent amount of time working on rebuilding my site with Quarto but the decision of should I rebuild my website was pretty impulsive. It’s not the first time I’ve hastily moved to a shiny new static site generator. Before that I was using Pelican and before that, Jykell; I suppose I love the process of trying to design something new and see how I can take advantage of something new to make it even easier to blog!\nI was going to make a joke about Field of Dreams and how I built it and the blog posts didn’t come. But that’s not the important part! The important part was that I went in the world wide web version of the yard to do my little project.\n\nWhat this post will not be is a complete end-to-end guide on building a website with Quarto. I think there are already a lot of great pieces of content and the docs are really well put together. I don’t want to just rehash what already exists. I thought it might be helpful to just document how I went about taking some things from the Quarto website and editing/altering for myself and really just focus on some of the aspects of using Quarto that were not initially clear and required some patience to work through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust keep in mind\n\n\n\nI’m by no means a front-end professional and a lot of what I’ve discovered putting this site together was from reading the docs, looking for examples, and trying things out. If you notice something that isn’t right; feel free to create an issue on the repo. Thanks!"

    "section": "<div>s and <span>s",
    "text": "<div>s and <span>s\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what’s going on here. If you’re new to this syntax of ::: {.some-class} ::: then take a bit of time to read the Quarto docs on divs and spans to gain a good foundation. In Pandoc these are called fenced divs.\nOnce you understand the syntax, it might not be apparent at first, but these fenced divs are extraordinarily flexible! Let’s break down the above code chunk:\nThe ::: {.content-block}::: is a <div> defining the padding for the top and bottom and the margin for the left and the right; here is the CSS from index.css:\n.content-block {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n  padding-bottom: 10px;\n  margin-left: 30px;\n  margin-right: 30px;\n}\nThis creates space on the page for the two main components:\n\n\n\n\nThe container\n\n\n::: {.features} :::\nSimilarly to the .content-block, this is like a row for the other content elements. On the Bootstrap 5 [page] you’ll see lots of examples of something like container -> row -> col.\n\n\n\n\nThe flexbox\n\n\n::: {.feature} :::\nThese are the individual elements of content. They’re like post-its with info on them. Each .feature is contained within the .features container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it together\n\n\n\nYou can think of the .container like a board you want to hang on the wall–the .features is like a sticky adhesive and the .feature the squares with notes on them that you stick to your board.\n\n\n\nFrom the docs, Bootstrap 5 uses a mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes. It can definitely be confusing if you haven’t ever written HTML before, so don’t worry if it isn’t clicking right away. Learning more about Bootstrap 5 will only enhance your Quarto experience if you’re interested. The better you understand the grid the more flexible you will be when thinking of how you want to arrange components on your site and what is available to you as ways to do that."

    "section": "New classes",
    "text": "New classes\n\nThe .content-block has not changed. So we don’t need to focus on that. There is a new addition to the .features class’ CSS though:\n.features {\n  padding-bottom: 2em;\n  height: calc(100% + 250px);\n}\nSo what is this height: calc(100% + 250px); doing? Well, it’s saying, whatever 100% of the height is for this normally, add an additional 250 pixels. Why we want to do this will become apparent with the next two classes:\n\n\n\n\n.feature-top\n\n\n.feature-top {\n  height: 75%;\n}\nWe want this <div> to take up 75% of .features’s height.\n\n\n\n\n.feature-bottom\n\n\n.feature-bottom {\n  height: 25%;\n}\nWe want this <div> to take up 25% of .features’s height\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to have the .feature divisible by two but in a way that allows for the bottom portion to align across .features rather than have the button in different positions based on the length of the document being highlighted by the document listing.\nNow, this may not be the best solution–I imagine that for someone that is an experienced front-end dev or someone that knows Lua could potentially do something much more elegant. This seemed to me to be the best way to accomplish this for myself. I see the buttons align and that makes me happy"

    "text": "EJS\n\nThe custom listings are written in Embedded JavaScript templating (EJS), which was very confusing for me. I’ll try to share what limited clarity I’ve been able to obtain but if this isn’t something you’ll want to do you can feel free to skip.\nI followed the example from quarto-web and created an ejs directory and then put my custom listing .ejs file in that directory. Before threading everything together, let’s just look at how the custom listing is working:\n<!-- attributes for item -->\n<!--  freeze,\n      title-block-banner,\n      title,\n      author,\n      date,\n      categories,\n      image,\n      path,\n      image-alt,\n      description,\n      filename,\n      file-modified,\n      reading-time,\n      sortableValues -->\n<% for (const item of items.slice(0, 1)) { %>\n  <h4><a href=\"<%- item.path %>\"><%= item.title %></a></h4>\n  <small>{{< fa calendar >}} <%= item.date %></small>\n<% } %> \nFirst, please excuse the low quality but high effort JavaScript. Second, notice the comment I added for the attributes available to us through the initial for loop. I wanted to keep these readily available in the event I need to create some other custom listing. Based on what it is you want to highlight you can change or alter this to see if it works for your purposes as well. What I wanted was just the most recent listing from a document list, so I only want one listing. That is the purpose of the .slice(0, 1) method. The goal is to not have to update the index.qmd ever–even when there are new blog posts, talks, or projects. I’m slicing this list for the very first (most recent) listing and just grabbing a minimal amount of attributes: its location, the title, and the date."

    "text": "Connecting it all together\n\nTo connect the custom listing you’ll need to add it in your .qmd file’s YAML header. Here’s an example from my index.qmd:\n---\ntitle: \"\"\npage-layout: full\ntitle-block-banner: true\nlisting: \n  - id: listing-blog\n    contents: \"blog/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n  - id: listing-talks\n    contents: \"talks/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n  - id: listing-projects\n    contents: \"projects/\"\n    template: /ejs/most-recent-only.ejs\n    sort: \"date desc\"\n---\nWhat this is saying is that Quarto will create an ID that can be used to know where on the page to have this listing display its listing and how to sort the listing. By setting sort: \"date desc\" in conjunction with the .slice method in the EJS template, that is how we’re able to get the most recent piece of content from these three categories.\nThen it’s as simple as adding the ID you specified in the YAML in a <div>, e.g.:\n::: {#listing-blog}\n:::\nIt took me a little bit of time to get a feel for how this all comes together so I’d recommend playing around with this a bit to build an intuition."
